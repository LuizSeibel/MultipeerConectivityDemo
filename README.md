# üì° MultipeerConnectivityDemo  

This repository contains a **chat demo** using **MultipeerConnectivity** in iOS. The project showcases how to establish **peer-to-peer communication** between Apple devices without requiring an internet connection.  

- üì≤ One device acts as the **host**, creating the chat room.  
- üë• Other devices can **join the room** and exchange messages.  
- üîÑ The connection is established via **Bluetooth and Wi-Fi**, allowing seamless discovery of nearby peers.  

This project is a great reference for developers looking to implement **local device communication** using the **MultipeerConnectivity framework** in Swift.
